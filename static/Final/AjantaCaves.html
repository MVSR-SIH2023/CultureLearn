                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <hr>
                        <p>The Ajanta Caves are 29 rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments dating from the second
                            century BCE to about 480 CE in the Aurangabad District of Maharashtra state in India. Ajanta
                            Caves are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Universally regarded as masterpieces of Buddhist
                            religious art, the caves include paintings and rock-cut sculptures described as among the
                            finest surviving examples of ancient Indian art, particularly expressive paintings that
                            present emotions through gesture, pose and form.
                            The caves were built in two phases, the first starting around the second century BCE and the
                            second occurring from 400 to 650 CE, according to older accounts, or in a brief period of
                            460–480 CE according to later scholarship.
                            The Ajanta Caves constitute ancient monasteries (Viharas) and worship-halls (Chaityas) of
                            different Buddhist traditions carved into a 75-metre (246 ft) wall of rock. The caves also
                            present paintings depicting the past lives and rebirths of the Buddha, pictorial tales from
                            Aryasura's Jatakamala, and rock-cut sculptures of Buddhist deities. Textual records suggest
                            that these caves served as a monsoon retreat for monks, as well as a resting site for
                            merchants and pilgrims in ancient India. While vivid colours and mural wall paintings were
                            abundant in Indian history as evidenced by historical records, Caves 1, 2, 16 and 17 of
                            Ajanta form the largest corpus of surviving ancient Indian wall-paintings.
                            The Ajanta Caves are mentioned in the memoirs of several medieval-era Chinese Buddhist
                            travellers. They were covered by jungle until accidentally "discovered" and brought to
                            Western attention in 1819 by a colonial British officer Captain John Smith on a
                            tiger-hunting party. The caves are in the rocky northern wall of the U-shaped gorge of
                            the river Waghur, in the Deccan plateau. Within the gorge are a number of waterfalls,
                            audible from outside the caves when the river is high.
                            With the Ellora Caves, Ajanta is one of the major tourist attractions of Maharashtra. It is
                            about 59 kilometres (37 miles) from the city of Jalgaon, Maharashtra, India, 104 kilometres
                            (65 miles) from the city of Aurangabad, and 350 kilometres (220 miles) east-northeast
                            of Mumbai.[8][20] Ajanta is 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the Ellora Caves, which
                            contain Hindu, Jain and Buddhist caves, the last dating from a period similar to Ajanta. The
                            Ajanta style is also found in the Ellora Caves and other sites such as the Elephanta
                            Caves, Aurangabad Caves, Shivleni Caves and the cave temples of Karnataka.

                                </h6>
                                <p>The Ajanta Caves date back to the 2nd century BCE, with the earliest caves believed
                                    to have been excavated during the Satavahana dynasty. The caves were initially used
                                    as simple viharas (monastic retreats) for Buddhist monks.</p>

                                <h6>Hinayana and Mahayana Phases (2nd century BCE - 6th century CE) - </h6>
                                <p>The caves went through different construction phases over several centuries.
                                    Initially, the caves followed Hinayana Buddhism, but later caves embraced Mahayana
                                    Buddhism. The transition is evident in the art and architecture of the caves.

                                <p>Around the 6th century CE, the Ajanta Caves were gradually abandoned. There are
                                    various theories about the reasons, including the decline of Buddhism in India, a
                                    shift in political patronage, and environmental factors.

                                <p>The Ajanta Caves remained hidden for centuries, buried under thick vegetation. In
                                    1819, a British officer named John Smith rediscovered the caves accidentally during
                                    a hunting expedition. The rediscovery brought international attention to the site.

                                <p>European scholars and archaeologists, including James Fergusson and Alexander
                                    Cunningham, played significant roles in documenting and preserving the Ajanta Caves.
                                    The intricate murals and sculptures found in the caves became subjects of scholarly
                                    study.

                                    recognizing their cultural and historical significance. The site attracts tourists,

                        <p>
                            The architecture of the Ajanta Caves is a remarkable testament to ancient Indian
                            craftsmanship and ingenuity. Carved into the horseshoe-shaped rock cliffs of the Waghora
                            River valley in Maharashtra, these caves showcase an intricate blend of religious, artistic,
                            and architectural excellence. Dating back to the 2nd century BCE and extending over several
                            centuries, the caves consist of both viharas (monasteries) and chaitya halls (prayer halls).
                            The architects meticulously carved the monastic caves into the rock face, creating spacious
                            halls adorned with intricately carved pillars and doorways. The chaitya halls, designed for
                            congregational worship, feature ribbed roofs imitating wooden structures, with an impressive
                            stupa at the far end. The facades of the caves display ornate sculptures and reliefs,
                            depicting scenes from the life of Buddha, various Bodhisattvas, and other mythological
                            narratives. The architects employed a keen understanding of rock mechanics, utilizing the
                            natural contours of the rock to enhance the aesthetic appeal. The precision in carving,
                            attention to detail, and the integration of religious symbolism make Ajanta Caves an
                            architectural marvel, providing insights into the artistic and spiritual aspirations of
                            ancient India. The caves' architecture not only served practical purposes for the monastic
                            community but also transcended into a canvas for expressing the profound narratives of
                            Buddhism through the language of stone.

                            divided into a nave and two narrower side aisles separated by a symmetrical row of pillars,
                            with a stupa in the apse. The stupa is surrounded by pillars and concentric walking space
                            for circumambulation. Some of the caves have elaborate carved entrances, some with large
                            windows over the door to admit light. There is often a colonnaded porch or verandah, with
                            another space inside the doors running the width of the cave. The oldest worship halls at
                            Ajanta were built in the 2nd to 1st century BCE, the newest ones in the late 5th century CE,
                            and the architecture of both resembles the architecture of a Christian church, but without
                            the crossing or chapel chevette. The Ajanta Caves follow the Cathedral-style architecture
                            found in still older rock-cut cave carvings of ancient India, such as the Lomas Rishi
                            Cave of the Ajivikas near Gaya in Bihar dated to the 3rd century BCE. These chaitya-griha
                            are called worship or prayer halls.
                            The four completed chaitya halls are caves 9 and 10 from the early period, and caves 19 and
                            26 from the later period of construction. All follow the typical form found elsewhere, with
                            high ceilings and a central "nave" leading to the stupa, which is near the back, but allows
                            walking behind it, as walking around stupas was (and remains) a common element of Buddhist
                            worship (pradakshina). The later two have high ribbed roofs carved into the rock, which
                            reflect timber forms, and the earlier two are thought to have used actual timber ribs and
                            are now smooth, the original wood presumed to have perished. The two later halls have a
                            rather unusual arrangement (also found in Cave 10 at Ellora) where the stupa is fronted by a
                            large relief sculpture of the Buddha, standing in Cave 19 and seated in Cave 26. Cave 29 is
                            a late and very incomplete chaitya hall.
                            The form of columns in the work of the first period is very plain and un-embellished, with
                            both chaitya halls using simple octagonal columns, which were later painted with images of
                            the Buddha, people and monks in robes. In the second period columns were far more varied and
                            inventive, often changing profile over their height, and with elaborate carved capitals,
                            often spreading wide. Many columns are carved over all their surface with floral motifs and
                            Mahayana deities, some fluted and others carved with decoration all over, as in cave 1.
