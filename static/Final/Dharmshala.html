                        <hr>
                        <p>Dharmashala Hill Station is the headquarter of Kangra District. Dharamshala is also known as Little Lhasa. Dharmashala is 18 km away from Kangra situated in the state of Himachal Pradesh. It was in the past known as Bhagsu. Dharmshala has developed into a worldwide and profoundly slanted town. It is likewise known for the living arrangement of Dalai Lama, the Nobel Laureate of the city of McLeodGanj. This is the motivation behind why Dharmshala Hill Station is affectionately likewise called ‘Little Tibet.’ Dharamshala has been chosen as one of the hundred Indian smart cities to be created as a proficient city under PM Narendra Modi’s Smart Cities Mission. Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh declared Dharamshala as the second capital of Himachal Pradesh state on 19 January 2017.

                        <h5>History of Dharmashala Hill Station</h5>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Dharmashala is the compound word of Dharam and Shala which means a shelter or rest house for spiritual pilgrims. Until the British Raj, Dharamshala and its surrounding area were ruled by the Katoch Dynasty of Kangra, a royal family that ruled the region for two millennia. The illustrious family still keeps a home in Dharamsala, known as ‘Clouds End Villa’. Under the British Raj, the districts were a piece of the unified territory of Punjab and were led by the governors of Punjab from Lahore. In 1848, the area now known as Dharamshala was occupied by the British. In 1848, the area now known as Dharamshala was annexed by the British.
                        </p>
                        <p>In 1860, the 66th Gurkha Light Infantry was moved from Kangra, Himachal Pradesh to Dharamshala. An ideal position for the new base was found on the slopes of the Dhauladhar Hills, near the site of a Hindu sanctuary, or Dharamshala. This was the commencement of the legend of the Gurkhas, also known as the ‘Bravest of the Brave’. The Gurkhas referred to Dharamshala as ‘Bhagsu’ and referred to themselves as Bhagsuwalas. Dharmshala was hit by a tremendous earthquake in 1905. After this earthquake, the new construction of Dharmshala started again. In 1959, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama came to India after the Chinese conquest of Tibet and was offered refuge in Mcleodganj.</p>
                        <p>In 1960, the Tibetan displaced people began moving to Dharmshala and henceforth, shaped their Government in a state of banishment. Today, this slope station has been partitioned into two sections, the lower part is called as the business base where local people remain while the upper part is overflowing with Tibetan shops and bistros alongside religious community and resorts. This upper part is called as McLeodGanj and Forsythe Ganj. Mcleodganj is named after David Mcleod, the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab.</p>
