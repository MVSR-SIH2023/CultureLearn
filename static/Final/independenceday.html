                        <hr>
                        <p>On August 15, 1947, India achieved independence from British colonisation. The day holds national pride and honour in the heart of every Indian citizen living in India and abroad as on this day, the nation secured full autonomy from the British.
                            Marking the historic day in 1947, was the first Prime Minister of Independent India Jawaharlal Nehru, who delivered a speech saying, “At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom.” Hoisting the Indian national flag on the Lahori Gate of Red Fort in Delhi, these words aptly captured the struggle and happiness of newly-independent India as it finally managed to free itself from the clutches of British rule.

                        <h5>History</h5>
                        <hr>
                        <p>European traders had established outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the late 17th century. Through overwhelming military strength, the East India Company fought and annexed local kingdoms and established themselves as the dominant force by the 18th century. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct control of India. In the decades following, civic society gradually emerged across India, most notably the Indian National Congress Party, formed in 1885. The period after World War I was marked by colonial reforms such as the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of the unpopular Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non-violent movements of non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.
                        </p>
                        <p>During the 1930s, the reform was gradually legislated by the British; Congress won victories in the resulting elections.  The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress' final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation was tempered by the bloody partition of colonial India into India and Pakistan. </p>

                        <h5>Significance</h5>
                        <hr>
                        <p>The partition of British India into the Dominions of India and Pakistan, which was accompanied by bloody riots, widespread deaths, and the eviction of almost 15 million people owing to religious violence, occurred concurrently with India's declaration of independence. Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, raised the country's flag over the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi on August 15, 1947. The current Prime Minister raises the flag and addresses the country on each successive Independence Day.</p>
