                        <hr>
                        <p>Onam
                            The vibrant land of India is home to a myriad of cultural traditions and festivals that
                            paint the country in a myriad of colours. One such festival is Onam, a grand celebration
                            synonymous with the Indian state of Kerala, also known as God’s Own Country.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Celebrated by the Malayali community, Onam is a festivity that marks the annual harvest
                                season and encompasses a plethora of cultural events across the state.</li>
                            <li>Onam celebrations involve decorating houses with Pookkalam (flower rangoli), savouring
                                Onasadya (a grand feast) and Payasam (a sweet dish from Kerala), and participating in
                                various games and traditional Kaikottikali dance.The festival's roots can be traced back
                                to the Sangam age, as mentioned in the poem “Maturaikkanci” (Maduraikanchi). The poem
                                illustrates a grand celebration at the Madurai temple, which is believed to be the early
                                form of Onam.</li>

                        <h5>Historical Evidence of Onam Festival</h5>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Ancient scriptures and historical records suggest that Onam has a deep-rooted religious
                            history in Kerala and its neighbouring regions in South India. Some notable references of
                            Onam are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The earliest mention of Onam is found in a Tamil poem “Maturaikkanci” from the Sangam
                                era. It describes people celebrating Onam in the Madurai temple, engaging in games and
                                sending offerings to the temple.</li>
                            <li>The 9th-century texts, Pallads and Pathikas by Periyazharwar, describe the festival as a
                                time of offerings to Lord Vishnu, community gatherings, and feasts.</li>
                            <li>The Thrikkakara Temple inscription from the 11th century describes Onam as a festival
                                dedicated to Vamana, an avatar of Vishnu. The text mentions that people would prepare
                                offerings two days in advance and on Thiru Onam.</li>
                            <li>The Tiruvalla Temple inscription from the 12th century also mentions the festival and
                                records a donation made to the temple as an offering.</li>
                            <li>Uddanda Sastrikal, a Sanskrit court poet of the Zamorin, referred to the Sravana
                                festival, which historians now believe was Onam, as Sravana is the Sanskrit name for
                                Thiruvonam.</li>

                        <h5>Significance of Onam</h5>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Onam is an ancient Hindu festival of Kerala that celebrates rice harvest. The significance of
                            the festival is in Indian culture, of which two are more common.

                        <h6>Mahabali and Vamana</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As per Hindu mythology, Mahabali, the grandson of sage Prahlada, emerged victorious
                                against the Gods and gained control over the three worlds. When the Gods sought Lord
                                Vishnu's help to defeat Mahabali, Vishnu refused, as Mahabali was a righteous ruler and
                                a devout follower.</li>
                            <li>Later, Mahabali performed a Yajna (sacrificial ritual) and vowed to grant any request
                                made by anyone. Seizing this opportunity, Lord Vishnu appeared as Vamana (a dwarf) and
                                asked for three steps of land. As Vamana took his steps, he grew in size and covered the
                                entire universe. For the third step, Mahabali offered his own head.</li>
                            <li>In his avatar as Vamana, Lord Vishnu pushed Mahabali to the underworld but was impressed
                                by his devotion. As a reward, he allowed Mahabali to visit his kingdom once every year.
                                This annual visit is celebrated as Onam in Kerala, in memory of the benevolent ruler.

                        <h6>Parashurama</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An alternate tale behind Onam relates to Parashurama, an incarnation of Vishnu who is
                                credited in Hinduism to have created the Western Ghats and Kerala. According to this
                                legend, Vishnu observed the kings of the Kshatriya (warrior) waging constant war on one
                                another and growing arrogant. He assumed the avatar of Parashurama, the warrior sage, in
                                the era of the king Kartavirya Arjuna. This king persecuted and oppressed the people,
                                the sages, and the gods.] Following the murder of his father Jamadagni, Parashurama
                                swore vengeance against the king and the warrior class, slaying them as he travelled the
                                world. When all the oppressors had been vanquished, he threw his axe into the ocean. The
                                ocean retreated from the region where the axe descended, creating the land of Kerala.
                                The Onam festival, according to this legend, celebrates Parashurama's creation of Kerala
                                by marking those days as the new year. </li>
                            <li>The legend and worship of Parashurama is attested in texts and epigraphs dated to about
                                the 2nd century CE.</li>

                        <hr>
                        <p>Here are some of the popular rituals and practices associated with Onam:
                        </p>
                        <h6>Music and Dance</h6>
                        <p>Traditional dance forms like Kathakali, Kummattikali, Thiruvathira Kali, Thumbi Thullal,
                            Pulikali or tiger dance, Onam Kali etc., are an integral part of Onam celebrations.
                            Kathakali dance is commonly performed during this time, with dancers enacting characters
                            from the various Ancient Indian legends. A famous venue for this is at Valluvanad which is
                            associated with the growth of Kathakali, and Cheruthuruthy, where Kerala Kalamandalam is
                            located. Puli Kali is a traditional folk dance where performers dress as tigers and hunters.

                            is a traditional dance performed by women on Thiruvathira, one of the ten days of Onam. It
                            involves synchronized movements and clapping. Kaikottikali is a traditional dance form where
                            women dance in a circle, clapping their hands in unison. It is often performed during the
                            Onam celebrations.

                    <h6>Post Onam celebrations</h6>
                    <p>Normally, the largest chunk of Onam celebrations ends by Thiruvonam. However, the two days
                        following Thiruvonam are also celebrated as Third and Fourth Onam. The third Onam, called
                        Avvittom marks the preparations for King Mahabali's return ascension to heavens. The main ritual
                        of the day is to take the Onathappan statue which was placed in the middle of every Pookkalam
                        during the past 10 days and immerse it in nearby rivers or sea. The Pookkalam will be cleaned
                        and removed after this ritual.
                        Onam is not just a festival; it's a celebration of Kerala's rich cultural heritage, communal
                        harmony, and the spirit of unity and prosperity. Onam, with its vibrant celebrations and rich
                        cultural heritage, is a significant part of the Indian festival calendar. It also offers
                        interesting insights into Indian mythology.
