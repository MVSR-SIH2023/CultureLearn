                        <p>Dhanurvidya, also known as Dhanurveda, is an ancient Indian martial art and science of
                            archery
                            that has its roots deeply embedded in Indian history and culture. The term "Dhanur" refers
                            to a
                            bow, and "Vidya" translates to knowledge or science. Therefore, Dhanurvidya can be

                            the science or knowledge of archery.
