                            of the game might have varied across different regions, the essence of Kabaddi as a contact

                        <hr>
                        <p>Chaugan, a term derived from the Persian word "ChaugƒÅn," which means "four corners" or "four
                            fields," refers to a traditional equestrian sport that was widely enjoyed in medieval India.
                            This sport, later known as Polo, involved players on horseback using mallets to hit a ball
                            into the opponent's goal. Chaugan held cultural significance and became a favored pastime,
                            particularly among the medieval Indian nobility.

                                opponent's goal.
