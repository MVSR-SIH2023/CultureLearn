                        <p>Republic Day marks the adoption of the constitution of India and the transition of the
                            country to a republic on January 26, 1950. Every year, the celebrations marking the day
                            feature spectacular military and cultural pageantry. In New Delhi, armed forces personnel
                            march along the Rajpath, in an elaborate display of military might. The epic show on Rajpath
                            eclipses everything else happening across the country on this auspicious day.

                        <h5>History of republic day</h5>
                        <hr>
                        <p>India achieved independence from the British Raj on 15 August 1947 following the success of
                            the Indian independence movement. The independence came through the Indian Independence Act
                            1947 (10 & 11 Geo 6 c 30), an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned
                            British India into the two new independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth (later
                            Commonwealth of Nations). India became a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of
                            state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general. The country, though, did not yet have a
                            permanent constitution; instead its laws were based on the modified colonial Government of
                            India Act 1935.
                        </p>
                        <p>On 29 August 1947, a resolution was moved for the appointment of a Drafting Committee, which
                            was appointed to draft a permanent constitution, with Dr B R Ambedkar as chairman. A draft
                            constitution was prepared by the committee and submitted to the Constituent Assembly on 4
                            November 1947. The Assembly met for 166 days in public sessions spanning two years, 11
                            months, and 17 days before adopting the Constitution. The 308 members of the Assembly signed
                            two handwritten copies of the document (one in Hindi and one in English) on 24 January 1950,
                            after much deliberation and some changes. Two days later, 26 January 1950, it came into
                            effect throughout the whole nation. While India's Independence Day celebrates its freedom
                            from British Rule, the Republic Day celebrates the coming into force of its constitution. On
                            that day, Dr Rajendra Prasad began his first term of office as President of the Indian
                            Union. The Constituent Assembly became the Parliament of India under the transitional
                            provisions of the new Constitution. </p>

                        <p>On November 25, 1949, in his final speech to the Constituent Assembly, Dr Ambedkar remarked about the potential and pitfalls of life after January 26, 1950:
                            On the 26th of January 1950, we are going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we will be recognising the principle of one man one vote and one vote one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value. How long shall we continue to live this life of contradictions? How long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and economic life? If we continue to deny it for long, we will do so only by putting our political democracy in peril. We must remove this contradiction at the earliest possible moment or else those who suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of political democracy which this Assembly has so laboriously built up.

                        <hr>
                        <p>India's constitution, which was formally adopted in 1950, replaced the British colonial Government of India Act (1935) as the country's governing text.
                            On January 26, 1950, the Preamble to the Constitution of India -- a statement presenting the key principles of the Constitution -- came into effect. This completed the country's transition to a sovereign republic. The Constitution establishes fundamental rights that should be enjoyed by all citizens of this country, regardless of their political beliefs. It also establishes some fundamental duties for all citizens of the country to abide by.
