                        <hr>
                        <p>Ugadi or Yugadi, also known as Samvatsaradi (meaning "beginning of the year"), is New Year's
                            Day according to the Hindu calendar and is celebrated in the states of Andhra Pradesh,
                            Telangana, Karnataka and Goa in India. We have total 60 Telugu Years, each year has its own
                            name. The day this nakshatra starts is called 'Ugadi'. The word Ugadi can be split into two,
                            Uga means Course of stars and Adi means Starting. It is festively observed in these regions
                            on the first day of the Hindu lunisolar calendar month of Chaitra. This typically falls in
                            late March or early April of the Gregorian calendar. It also falls during the Tamil month of
                            either Panguni or Chithrai, sometimes on the day after Amavasya with 27th Nakshatra Revati.
                            Ugadi day is pivoted on the first New Moon after March Equinox.
                            Ugadi has been an important and historic festival of the Hindus, with medieval texts and
                            inscriptions recording major charitable donations to Hindu temples and community centers on
                            this day.[7] The same day is observed as a New Year by Hindus in many other parts of India,
                            such as Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra and is a national public holiday in Mauritius.

                        <h5>Celebrations</h5>
                        <hr>
                        <p>The Telugu, Kannada, Kodava and the Tulu diaspora in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and
                            Tamil Nadu celebrate the festival with great fanfare; gatherings of the extended family and
                            a sumptuous feast are 'de rigueur'. The day begins early with ritual showers, rubbing the
                            body with perfumed oil, followed by prayers.
                            Preparations for the festival begin a week ahead. Houses are given a thorough clean.People
                            buy new clothes, including dhoti, and buy new items for the festival, decorate the entrance
                            of their houses with fresh mango leaves. Mango leaves and coconuts are considered auspicious
                            in the Hindu tradition, and they are used on Ugadi. People also clean the front of their
                            house with water and cow dung paste, then draw colorful floral designs.] People offer
                            prayers in temples. The celebration of Ugadi is marked by religious zeal and social
                            merriment. According to Vasudha Narayanan, a professor of Religion at the University of
                            Florida:
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Ugadi Pacchadi is a symbolic dish prepared by Hindu people on this festival
                            Ugadi Pacchadi combines ingredients to give all six flavours of food (షడ్రుచులు - ṣaḍruculu)
                            : sweet (తీపి - tīpi), sour (పులుపు - pulupu), salty (ఉప్పు - uppu), spicy (కారం - kāraṁ),
                            bitter (చేదు - cēdu) and astringent (వగరు - vagaru). This festive Hindu food is made from
                            tamarind paste (sour), neem flowers (bitter), brown sugar or sweet jaggery (sweet), table
                            salt (salt), green chilli (spicy) and raw mango (astringent).
                            The pacchadi festive dish symbolically reminds the people that the following year – as all
                            of life – will consist of not just sweet experiences, but a combination of sweet, sour,
                            salty, and bitter episodes. Just as the different substances are bound together, one is
                            reminded that no event or episode is wholly good or bad. Even in the midst of bitter
                            experiences, there are sweet moments. One is also reminded that the experience of taste is
                            transitory and ephemeral; so too, is life, and one has to learn to put pain and pleasure in
                            proper temporal perspective.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Special dishes are prepared for the occasion. In Karnataka, foods such as Holige or Obattu,
                            and mango pickles are made. In addition, a speciality of yugadi in Karnataka is to create
                            "bEvu-bella" a mixture of neem and jaggery. This symbolizes life's own experiences with a
                            little bit of bitternes and a hint of sweetness. In Andhra Pradesh, foods such as pulihora,
                            bobbatlu (Bhakshalu/ polelu/ oligale), New Year Burelu and Pachadi, and preparations made
                            with raw mango go well with the occasion.</p>
