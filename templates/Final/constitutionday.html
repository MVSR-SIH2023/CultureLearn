                        <p>Constitution Day also known as 'Samvidhan Divas', is celebrated in our country on 26th November every year to commemorate the adoption of the Constitution of India.

                        <hr>
                        <p>Since 2015 was the 125th birth anniversary year of B. R. Ambedkar (14 April 1891 â€“ 6 December 1956), who is known as the father of the Indian constitution, the government decided in May 2015 to celebrate this year "in a big way". A special committee chaired by Prime Minister of India was announced for year-long celebrations. Various programmes will be held by various ministries and departments throughout the year to spread thoughts and ideas of Ambedkar. As part of the celebrations while laying foundation stone for an Ambedkar memorial at the Indu Mills compounds in Mumbai in October 2015, the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi announced that 26 November will be celebrated as "Constitution Day".In November 2015, the government officially announced celebration of the day.
