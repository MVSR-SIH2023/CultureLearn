									Vedas, meaning “knowledge,” were written in Vedic Sanskrit between 1500 and 500 BCE
									in the northwestern region the Indian Subcontinent. The Vedas were transmitted
									orally during the course of numerous subsequent generations before finally being
									archived in written form. Not much is known about the authors of the Vedas, as the
									focus is placed on the ideas found in Vedic tradition rather than those who
									originated the ideas. The oldest of the texts is the Rig Veda, and while it is not
									possible to establish precise dates for each of the ancient texts, it is believed
									the collection was completed by the end of the 2nd millennium BCE (Before Common
									Era).
									There are four Indo-Aryan Vedas: the Rig Veda contains hymns about their mythology;
									the Sama Veda consists mainly of hymns about religious rituals; the Yajur Veda
									contains instructions for religious rituals; and the Atharva Veda consists of spells
									against enemies, sorcerers, and diseases. (Depending on the source consulted, these
									are spelled, for example, either Rig Veda or Rigveda.)

									Vedangas developed as ancillary studies for the Vedas, but its insights into meters,

								<p>Hinduism encompasses the philosophies, worldviews and teaching of Hinduism itself
									since Ancient India. Shad Darshan is one such system of philosophy that gives the
									details of the real world and how there is a distinctive approach towards obtaining
									the exposition of sacred scripture as well as authoritative knowledge.
									However, When it comes to Indian Philosophy the term Shad Darshana plays a distinct
									role where the system looks at things, including its exposition of sacred scriptures
									and authoritative knowledge. The Six Principles of Hindu darshanas are the
									following: Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta. Non-Hindu
									Darshana includes Buddhism and Jainism. Each of these systems of philosophy was
									formulated in sutras through ancient times and elaborated extensively by its
									writers. They are dedicated to providing various attempts at describing truth and
									the path to finding it. Each of these elements forms a core part of the Hindu
									Scriptures and the religion itself.

								<p>Puranas are influential texts of the Hindu faith. Translating literally as "ancient"
									or "old", they were written thousands of years ago by unknown authors. Containing
									the knowledge, myths, and genealogical information of important figures, there are
									total of 18 Puranas. The Puranas are revered as important texts in Hinduism and
									played a significant role in Indian historical events.Scholars heavily contest the
									origin of the Puranas. While it is often credited to Vyasa, who narrated the
									Mahabharata (another important Hindu text), it is more likely that many individuals
									contributed to their creation. Their dates of creation span more than a thousand
									years, from the middle of the first millennium BCE to 1000 CE. It is unknown why the
									texts were specifically created. However, the knowledge contained within, such as
									pilgrimage information, temple locations, and detailed accounts of local geography,
									might have been to preserve the information for future generations.

									Upanishad, one of four genres of texts that together constitute each of the Vedas,
									the sacred scriptures of most Hindu traditions. Each of the four Vedas—the Rigveda,
									Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda—consists of a Samhita (a “collection” of hymns
									or sacred formulas); a liturgical prose exposition called a Brahmana; and two
									appendices to the Brahmana—an Aranyaka (“Book of the Wilderness”), which contains
									esoteric doctrines meant to be studied by the initiated in the forest or some other
									remote place, and an Upanishad, which speculates about the ontological connection
									between humanity and the cosmos. Because the Upanishads constitute the concluding
									portions of the Vedas, they are called vedanta (“the conclusion of the Vedas”), and
									they serve as the foundational texts in the theological discourses of many Hindu
									traditions that are also known as Vedanta. The Upanishads’ impact on later
									theological and religious expression and the abiding interest they have attracted
									are greater than that of any of the other Vedic texts.

									Itihasa (Sanskrit: इतिहास, lit. 'traditional accounts of past events') refers to the
									collection of written descriptions of important events in Hinduism. It includes the
									Mahabharata, the Puranas and the Ramayana. The Mahabharata includes the story of the
									Kurukshetra War and preserves the traditions of the Lunar dynasty in the form of
									embedded tales. The Puranas narrate universal history – the books discuss in depth
									the topics of cosmogony, myth, legend and history. The Ramayana contains the story
									of Rama and is incidentally related to the legends of the Solar dynasty. A story is
									considered to be itihasa only when the author of the story has himself witnessed or
									is part of the story. Vyasa, who wrote the Mahabharata, is himself a character in
									the story. Similarly, Valmiki, who wrote the Ramayana, was also a character in the
									story. Many classical Indian poets derive the plots of their poetry and drama from
									the Itihasa. The tradition of itihāsa is generally understood to be developed by the
									bardic tradition of Sūtas and Cāraṇas whose duties consisted of composing royal
									eulogies.

									According to the Hindu texts, time is cyclic. The history of mankind is divided into
									four ages—Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga—collectively forming
									one Maha Yuga. Seventy-one Maha Yugas form a Manvantara ("age of Manu"), a period of
									time over which a "Manu" presides. For the duration of his period, each Manu is the
									archetypal first man, the progenitor of humanity, and also the first king and
									lawgiver. Along with a Manu, every Manvantara also has its own set of Indra, gods
									and the seven sages. Fourteen Manus reign in Kalpa, (a single day in the life of)
									Brahma), an equivalent of 1,000 Maha Yugas, at the end of which, the creation is
									destroyed and is followed by a Pralaya (dissolution) of equal length. The creation
									starts again, in the next Kalpa in an endless cycle of creations and dissolutions.

								<h4>Mahabharata</h4>
								<p>The Mahābhārata (/məˌhɑːˈbɑːrətə, ˌmɑːhə-/ mə-HAH-BAR-ə-tə, MAH-hə-;Sanskrit:
									महाभारतम्, Mahābhāratam, pronounced [mɐɦaːˈbʱaːrɐt̪ɐm]) is one of the two major
									Sanskrit epics of ancient India revered in Hinduism, the other being the Rāmāyaṇa.
									It narrates the events and aftermath of the Kurukshetra War, a war of succession
									between two groups of princely cousins, the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas.
									The epic is traditionally ascribed to the sage Vyāsa, who is also a major character
									in the epic.[10] Vyāsa described it as being an itihāsa (transl. history). He also
									describes the Guru–shishya tradition, which traces all great teachers and their
									students of the Vedic times.

								<h4>Ramayana</h4>
								<p>
									The Ramayana, attributed to the sage Valmiki, is an ancient Sanskrit epic that
									narrates the life and adventures of Lord Rama, an avatar of the god Vishnu.
									Comprising seven books or "Kandas," the epic is a foundational text in Hinduism,
									profoundly influencing cultural and religious traditions in South and Southeast
									Asia. The narrative begins with the Balakanda, introducing the lineage and early
									exploits of Rama, including his marriage to Sita. The Ayodhyakanda delves into
									political intrigue leading to Rama's exile, while the Aranyakanda chronicles his
									forest life. In the Kishkindhakanda, Rama forms alliances in the search for Sita,
									while the Sundarakanda focuses on Hanuman's heroic deeds. The Yuddhakanda climaxes
									with the epic war against the demon king Ravana, culminating in his defeat and
									Sita's rescue. The Uttarakanda addresses the aftermath, yet its inclusion is debated
									among different versions. The Ramayana, with its moral, philosophical, and cultural
									dimensions, continues to be a source of inspiration and contemplation for millions,
									reflecting timeless themes of duty, righteousness, and devotion

									The religious books of the Jains and the Buddhists refer to historical persons or
									incidents. The earliest Buddhist works were written in Pali, which was spoken in
									Magadha and South Bihar. The Buddhist works can be divided into the canonical and
									the non-canonical. The canonical literature is best represented by the “Tripitakas”,
									that is, three baskets Vinaya Pitika, Sutta Pitika and AbhidhammaPitika. Vinaya
									Pitika deals with rules and regulations of daily life. Sutta Pitaka contains
									dialogues and discourses on morality and deals with Dharma while AbhidhammaPitaka
									deals with philosophy and metaphysics. It includes discourses on varioussubjects
									such as ethics, psychology, theories of knowledge and mataphysical problems. The
									non-canonical literature is best represented by the Jatakas. Jatakas are the most
									interesting stories on the previous births of the Buddha. It was believed that
									before he was finally born as Gautama, the Buddha practising Dharma passed through
									more than 550 births, in many cases even in the form of animals. Each birth story is
									called a Jataka. The Jatakas throw invaluable light on the social and economic
									conditions ranging from the sixth century BC to the second century BC. They also
									make incidental reference to political events in the age of the Buddha.

									Bhakti literature, rooted in the devotional movements that emerged in medieval
									India, encompasses a diverse range of poetic and philosophical expressions. Bhakti,
									meaning devotion, emphasized a personal and emotional connection with the divine,
									transcending traditional social and religious boundaries. Saints and poets like
									Kabir, Mirabai, Tulsidas, and Namdev composed verses in regional languages,
									expressing deep love and surrender to their chosen deities. These compositions,
									often in the form of hymns and poetry, aimed to foster a direct and intimate
									relationship with the divine, rejecting ritualistic formalities and caste
									distinctions. Bhakti literature contributed significantly to the cultural and
									spiritual landscape of India, promoting a more inclusive and egalitarian approach to

									Sufi literature emerged as a parallel tradition within Islam, emphasizing a mystical
									and inward journey towards divine realization. Sufi poets and thinkers such as Rumi,

									Persian and later in regional languages like Urdu. Sufi literature often employs

									Ancient education in India had a strong foundation in traditional systems that were
									deeply rooted in the cultural and philosophical fabric of the society. The education
									system in ancient India was primarily oral and informal, with an emphasis on
									transmitting knowledge through direct teacher-student interactions. Several key
									aspects defined the ancient education system:
								</p>
								<h3>Gurukula System</h3>
								<hr>
								<p>
									The Gurukul system was a traditional form of education in ancient India that held a
									central place in the cultural and educational landscape. In this system, students,
									known as shishyas, lived in close proximity with their guru or teacher in a
									residential setting called a Gurukul. The Gurukul was not just an educational
									institution; it was a holistic environment where students imbibed knowledge, skills,
									and values through direct interactions with their guru. The curriculum of the
									Gurukul system was comprehensive, covering a range of subjects such as scriptures,
									philosophy, science, mathematics, arts, and warfare. Learning was predominantly
									oral, with a strong emphasis on memorization, recitation, and practical application.
									The guru, often a revered and knowledgeable figure, played a multifaceted role as a
									teacher, mentor, and spiritual guide. The Gurukul system fostered a personalized
									approach to education, tailoring the curriculum to the individual needs and aptitude
									of each student. This ancient educational system laid the foundation for a deep and
									holistic understanding of various aspects of life and left an enduring impact on the
									cultural and educational heritage of India.

								<p>
									The oral tradition in ancient India constituted a fundamental aspect of the
									cultural, educational, and social fabric. In this tradition, knowledge, wisdom, and
									cultural heritage were transmitted verbally from one generation to the next,
									fostering a rich and dynamic form of communication. Sacred texts, philosophical
									teachings, historical narratives, and cultural practices were passed down through
									spoken words, emphasizing the art of memorization and recitation. This oral
									tradition played a crucial role in preserving and disseminating knowledge,
									especially in a society where the written word was not as prevalent. Through
									storytelling, chanting, and recitals, communities maintained a deep connection to
									their roots, rituals, and philosophical underpinnings. The oral tradition was not
									merely a means of communication; it was a living repository of the collective wisdom
									of a society, ensuring the continuity of cultural values and teachings. This
									tradition, marked by its fluidity and adaptability, contributed significantly to the
									cultural richness and intellectual heritage of ancient India.

									lived in close proximity to their guru, fostering a deep and personal connection.
									The guru was responsible for imparting knowledge, instilling values, and guiding the

								<hr>
								<p>
									Education for women was quite important in ancient India. They were trained in
									housekeeping, as well as in dancing and music. Girls also had to conduct the
									Upanayana ceremony. Educated women were divided into two classes –Sadyodwahas, those
									who pursued their education just until they got married, and Brahmavadinis, those
									who never married and continued studying throughout their lives. Vedas and Vedangas
									were taught to women, too, but were limited to religious songs and poems necessary
									for rituals. Some notable Vedic and Upanishad women scholars were Apala, Indrani,
									Ghoshala, Lopamudra, Gargi and Maitreyi.

									Islam played a pivotal role in medieval India, beginning with the arrival of Arab
									traders and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate in the 13th century. The
									medieval period saw the flourishing of Islamic culture, governance, and scholarship
									on the Indian subcontinent. The Delhi Sultanate, followed by the Mughal Empire,
									brought about a synthesis of Islamic and indigenous Indian cultures. The
									architectural marvels of the Mughals, such as the Taj Mahal, exemplify the fusion of
									Islamic and Indian artistic styles. Islamic education thrived with the establishment
									of madrasas, where scholars delved into Islamic studies, theology, law, and
									philosophy. Sufi saints played a crucial role in spreading Islam through their
									teachings, emphasizing a more personal and direct connection with the divine. While
									Islamic rulers like Akbar promoted a policy of religious tolerance and patronized
									the arts and sciences, the period also witnessed instances of religious conflicts.
									Overall, Islam left an enduring impact on the socio-cultural fabric of medieval
									India, contributing to a rich tapestry of diversity and influencing various aspects

								<hr>
								<p>
									Traditional Hindu education in medieval India was primarily imparted through the
									Gurukul system, which served as a foundational institution for the transmission of
									knowledge, values, and skills. In this system, students, known as shishyas, resided
									with their guru (teacher) in a Gurukul, creating an immersive learning environment.
									The curriculum included the study of sacred scriptures such as the Vedas,
									Upanishads, and other religious texts, along with subjects like philosophy,
									astronomy, mathematics, music, and the arts. The emphasis was not only on
									intellectual growth but also on moral and spiritual development. The guru, often a
									revered figure, played a multifaceted role as a teacher, guide, and mentor.
									Education was personalized, with the guru tailoring the curriculum to the individual
									needs and aptitude of each student. The Gurukul system fostered a holistic approach
									to learning, connecting students with nature and integrating theoretical knowledge
									with practical skills. Temples and monasteries also functioned as centers of
									learning, contributing to the preservation and dissemination of traditional Hindu
									knowledge. Despite the challenges and changes during the medieval period,
									traditional Hindu education remained a cornerstone of cultural continuity and
									intellectual heritage in India.

								<h3 id="Universities and Reforms">Universities and Reforms</h3>
								<hr>
								<p>
									The establishment of universities and educational reforms in India during the
									colonial period marked a crucial phase in the evolution of the country's educational
									system. The Wood's Despatch, presented by Sir Charles Wood in 1854, laid the
									foundation for a systematic approach to education. It recommended the establishment
									of universities as centers for higher learning and the introduction of a uniform
									curriculum. Subsequently, the University of Calcutta (1857), Bombay University (now
									Mumbai University, 1857), and Madras University (1857) were founded, becoming
									pioneers in providing higher education. These universities played a pivotal role in
									shaping the intellectual landscape of colonial India, offering degrees in diverse
									disciplines. The Wood's Despatch also emphasized the importance of primary
									education, recommending the establishment of schools and the training of teachers.
									This period of university formation and educational reforms laid the groundwork for
									the structured educational system that would undergo further developments in the
									post-independence era. The recommendations set forth in the Wood's Despatch and the
									establishment of universities were pivotal in fostering a more organized and
									comprehensive approach to education in India during the 19th century.
