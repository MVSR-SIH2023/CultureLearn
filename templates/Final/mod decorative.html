                           have a significant impact on modern Indian interiors. Designers draw inspiration from international styles while
                           infusing them with an Indian sensibility, creating a contemporary and cosmopolitan look.
                        </p>

                            patterns, and textures adds character to the space.Art plays a crucial role in modern Indian interiors. Many
                            designers and homeowners showcase local art, traditional paintings, and contemporary photography to add a 
                            personal touch to the space.It's important to note that India is a vast and diverse country with a multitude
                            of design influences, and interior design trends can vary significantly across regions. Additionally, the
                            design landscape is dynamic, with new trends emerging over time.
