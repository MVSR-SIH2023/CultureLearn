                        <h5>Contemporary Dance</h5>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Contemporary dance in India encompasses a wide range of dance activities currently performed in India.
                             It includes choreography for Indian cinema, modern Indian ballet and experiments with existing classical
                              and folk forms of dance by various artists.<br>

                            Uday Shankar and Shobana Jeyasingh have led modern Indian ballet which combined classical Indian dance
                             and music with Western stage techniques. Their productions have included themes related to Shiva-Parvati,
                              Lanka Dahan, Panchatantra, Ramayana among others
                        </p>
                        <h5>Dance in Bollywood Film</h5>
                        <p>The presentation of Indian dance styles in film, Hindi Cinema, has exposed the range of dance in India to a global audience.

                            Dance and song sequences have been an integral component of films across the country. With the introduction of sound to the
                             cinema in the film Alam Ara in 1931, choreographed dance sequences became ubiquitous in Hindi and other Indian films.<br>
                             Dance in early Hindi films was primarily modeled on classical Indian dance styles such as Kathak,
                              or folk dancers. Modern films often blend this earlier style with Western dance styles 
                              (MTV or in Broadway musicals), though it is not unusual to see western choreography and
                               adapted classical dance numbers side by side in the same film. Typically, the hero or
                                heroine performs with a troupe of supporting dancers. Many song-and-dance routines 
                                in Indian films feature dramatic shifts of location and/or changes of costume between
                                 verses of a song. It is popular for a hero and heroine to dance and sing a pas de deux
                                  (a French ballet term, meaning "dance of two") in beautiful natural surroundings
                                   or architecturally grand settings, referred to as a "picturisation". Indian films 
                                   have often used what are now called "item numbers" where a glamorous female figure 
                                   performs a cameo. The choreography for such item numbers varies depending on the film's 
                                   genre and situation. The film actress and dancer Helen was famous for her cabaret numbers.<br>
                                   Often in movies, the actors don't sing the songs themselves that they dance too, themselves but have 
                                   another artist sing in the background. For an actor to sing in the song is unlikely but not rare.
                                    The dances in Bollywood can range from slow dancing to a more upbeat hip-hop style dance.
                                     The dancing itself is a fusion of all dance forms. 
                                   It could be Indian classical, Indian folk dance, belly dancing, jazz, hip-hop, and everything else you can imagine.</p>

                        <h5>Contemporary Indian Theater</h5>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Modern Indian theater, shaped by the convergence of Sanskrit, folk, and Western traditions,
                             finds its foundational roots in the latter. Emerging in the 19th century, it grappled with 
                             pressing issues of nationalism, self-identity, and modernity. The Western influence,
                              particularly through realism and naturalism, brought new dramatic techniques. Playwrights
                               like Tagore addressed these themes, fostering a cultural awakening. As a dynamic 
                               amalgamation of ancient heritage and global perspectives, modern Indian theater
                                explores diverse narratives, reflecting the complex socio-cultural landscape of India.
                                This synthesis of traditions continues to evolve, contributing to the vibrant tapestry of India’s theatrical expression.
